## tussi friday column: What does it mean to be a defense attorney? What about morality? 

Mostly there is the same discussion - how can someone defend a criminal, a bad person and you know the person is guilty?  
To understand the work of a defense attorney it is important to understand the duties of an defense attorney. 
Describing the work of a defense attorney it is a mix of psychology, law and emotions. The job of a defense attorney is about supervising 
the trail and to wise your client of his/her rights. Because regulary the accused is not aware of his/her rights in a criminal trail. 
Therefore a defense attorney is essential for a fair trail. It is not the job of a defense attorney to judge about your client but to give him advice. 
The defense attorney is the only trusted and confidential person the accused has. So one of the main jobs is to creat equal fire power in court 
between the judge and the prosecution. 
But even if you explain the job of a defense attorney as to maintain the accused rights and to watch out for a fair trail people express their 
reservation about the job. Because than it comes to morality. 
What about morality? Don't you have morality when defending a accused peron? 
A defense attorney usually has morality. Especially because he/she has a morality it is important to be part of a fair trail, to supervise and to give 
legal advise. Of course every trail leaves marks but that does not change the persuasion that a fair trail is the most important of a state under the rule of law. 
Even if someone would be guilty - which is the judges job to decide of someones guilt - a constitutional state should never give up the rigth to defend during a trail. 
Because what would happen if we wouldn't have a trail. At the end it would me that not only guilty but a lot of not guilty people will be sentenced. 
Therefore under every circumstances we need to be aware of the principles of a fair criminal trail which are part of the constitutional state. 

The principles of a fair criminal trail in Germany are: 

1. principle of public
2. principle of orality
3. principle of ex officio 
4. principle of accusation
5. principle of legality
6. principle of inspection
7. principle of the acceleration of the trail
8. principle of a lawful judge
9. principle of the persumption of innocence

At the end all these princples must be implemented in a fair trail which for a accused person is hard to supervise. Therefore a defence attorney
is at least as important as a judge or the prosecution and strengthens the constituional state.
